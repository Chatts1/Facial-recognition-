# Facial-recognition- 
Non-intrusive and natural emotion measurement
Basic facial expression include Anger (AN), Disgust (DI), Fear (FE), Neutral (NE), Sadness (SA), Surprise (SU), Happiness (HA). 
Some versions of the facial action coding system (FACS) exceed 60
First, we resize the images fomr the dataset to make them uniform amd make them into image size (ex 50,50). Using either Tensorflow or Open CV to generate labels or alsternatively make them into indexes for making the labels.
Importing Conv2D to build a convolution neural network and compile a model.

1. We have emotion detection py in test and src
2. Tensorflow
3. OpenCv
